"\nWikidata contains 6102 subclasses of \"cell ([Q7868](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7868))\" as of 20 of April of 2023. \nFrom those, 550 cell classes are specific for humans, and 318 are specific for mice.  \nCurrently Wikidata has more cell classes than the Cell Ontology, which lists 2577 classes. \nIt is worth noticing that classes on the Cell Ontology are added after careful consideration by ontologists and domain experts and should be considered of higher quality than the ones on Wikidata. \n\nFrom the 6102 cell classes on Wikidata, 5981 (98.0%) have been edited somehow by User:TiagoLubiana, and 4686 (76.8%) have been created by User:TiagoLubiana. \nEdits included adding multilanguage labels, connecting a dangling Wikipedia page to the cell subclass hierarchy, adding identifiers, images, markers, and other pieces of information. \nApproximatedly 430 hundred terms were added via manual curation based on PanglaoDB entries, while the remaining 4256 entries were created either via Wikidata's web interface or via the curation workflow described in this chapter. \nThese statistics are demonstration of how the curation system efficiently contributes to the status of cell type information on Wikidata.\n"
